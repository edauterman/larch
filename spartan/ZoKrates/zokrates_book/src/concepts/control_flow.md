## Control Flow

ZoKrates provide a single thread of execution with two control flow constructs.

### Function calls

Function calls can help make programs clearer and more modular. However, using function calls is not always zero-cost, so deep call chains should be avoided.

Arguments are passed by value.

```zokrates
{{#include ../../../zokrates_cli/examples/book/side_effects.code}}
```

### If expressions

An if expression allows you to branch your code depending on a condition.

```zokrates
{{#include ../../../zokrates_cli/examples/book/if_else.code}}
```

The condition supports `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, which can be combined with the boolean operators `&&`, `||` and `!`.

>When it comes to inequality checks, there is a caveat: when executing `a < b`, both `a` and `b` will be asserted to be strictly lower than the biggest power of 2 lower than `p/2`. This means that `a` and `b` are both asserted to be between `0` and `2**252 - 1`. The same applies to other inequality checks.

### For loops

For loops are available with the following syntax:

```zokrates
{{#include ../../../zokrates_cli/examples/book/for.code}}
```

The bounds have to be known at compile time, so only constants are allowed.
For-loops define their own scope.
